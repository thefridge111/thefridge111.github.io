<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Welcome!</h2>

I'm Will Perry. Software engineer with diverse interests. Right now I'm a full-stack web developer for a small [research firm](https://nuari.net/) in Northfield, VT. When I'm not writing code I enjoy working out, brewing beer and playing video games. I'm also a history buff with my most recent addiction being, the easily digestible, [Extra History](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhyKYa0YJ_5Aq7g4bil7bnGi0A8gTsawu) on YouTube.
